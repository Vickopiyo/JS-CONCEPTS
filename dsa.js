// DS = methods and techniques to maintain data in strucured format 
// DS used to bulid dependencies and building connections 

//  2. Diff btwn file structure and data strcuture 
// file structure is stored on hard disk while data structures stored on both harddisk and RAM  
// file structure has low compatibility wtih other external  apps while ds has high compatibility wiht external app

// Lnked list----every indivdual in linked list is called node
    // node connect to each other to form a chain(linkedlist) and each chain has address used to access data  

    // types of linked list-- circular,double,single  and more
        // linked list are both linear and non-linear
        // non-linear if for storage policies 
        // linear--for retrivsl purposes

    // where are DS used in A.I, O.S, Lexical analysis, Database handling ,statistics,numerical computation   

    // database handling to form stcaks and queus make orgainises way of accessing data structures 

        //    types of data structure searching
        //   1.LInear-moving accross data in a linear way,one after another
    //       2.Binary- more efficient--splits data into chunks(two) and searches on the left side and rigth side
    //  binary searches ordered data 2. binary start searche from middle and compares data with the middle value 3.order of data arrangement is key   


    //    QEUE
    //    used to denote ordered access and manipulation of events...are added one after another and proccesed on frontend..FCFS basis       First come First Serve 


        // what is a binary tree(extended linked list) ?
        //  atree like strcuture that has a primary node(rootnode ) that two other nodes on the right and left and this nodes cannhave other nodes exponentially

    //    binary tree can have a minimum of 0 node or 1 or two...0 if the value is null or if the rootnode value is zero





            // STACK ---data van only be used one point at a time 

            //   LIFO -- last in,first out


    //    what is a binary  search  tree?

    //     consists of root node with two nodes whereby the value on the left node is LESSER than the rootnode while the value on the right node is HIGHER than the rootnode  


    //   difference btw void and null 
    //      void a data type has been declared with  no value intialized(no size )  with  while  null is value with no physical presence in memory but seeing a particular state of the value


    // Dynamic mmemory management --technique where data storage units are allocated based on continous requirements 
        // individual data structures can be stored seperately or grouped to form composites (changes when data changes)

        // VARIABLE is stored based on the amount of memory its needed  then stored based on the data structure  ..Dynamic aloaction effeceincy when the variable is used   



        // MERGE SORT - sorting using divide and conquer.adjacents data are sorted first every iteration   to form a sorted list..Smallsorted list end up formng the sorted list 
          

        // HEAP(data structure )-why it is preffered over stack 
        //    memory structure and access time in satck in comparatively low
        // inn heap memory allocation in a head is dynamic and can be allocated and removed as per the requirement


        //    DATA ABSTRACTION - technique used to complex  entities into smaller chunks and solve them using data structures techniques..User focus is on operations and not how data is stored or represented
             

        // POST FIX expressions 
        //    scenerio where every operator is preceeded by its  operands.Eliminates the need for paranthesis 
        //used to remove all paranthesis and sub expression

    //    SELECTION SORT 
        // a way of sorting the data by finding the smallest entity and set the index to zero then iterating through the rest while indexing them
        //   SIGNED NUMBERS 
        //    numbers that have a bit in the begining which denotes a whether a number is positive or negative 
    //   if number is 1 then its -tive if 0 then its positive


    //   POINTERS--used to point to address of a particular data structure (linked list,queues,stack,)
    //     Dynamic data structure --provide flexibilty in terms of the provision of data storage and manipulation techniques..changes during execution of program or operation of algorithm 



    // PRIORITY QUEUE--is a regualar queue wiht a list of priority
    //   Analogy of allowing an ambulance in a traffuic jam

    // minimum queues will have queue with data and another queue where you will associate the data
